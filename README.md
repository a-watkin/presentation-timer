# Presentation Timer


Presentation Timer is a small application intended to help academics and other people practice presentations with strict time limits.

It allows for up to two warnings to be displayed visually or audibly or both at any time during the presentation. The visual warning is modelled after how academic conferences warn presenters about how much time they have remaining.

Requirements about the presentation process at conferences were elicited from Jaana Eigi who provided valuable insights.  

The program is written in python and uses the Tkinter interface to present a GUI to the user.

It has also been converted to an exe using py2exe which should allow it to run on windows without python being installed. Currently everything in the dist folder here would be required for it to run.

There is also a Javascript version which can currently be found [here](https://a-watkin.github.io/).
